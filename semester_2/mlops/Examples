Imagine being Megan Fox and having machine gun Kelly as your twin flame. It could always be worse.

There are days I wonder if this world ever stop breaking my heart. And I remember the answer is no and I have to build better methods of care to deal with this truth. So I try to walk this earth unbroken but still broken. Doing what I can in the midst of this utter chaos. Knowing my “alive” means something. My wellness matters. And we must not give up. I am posting less because … everything feels really hard. I still wish everyone a goodnight…. And especially to grievers.

While Trump and Elon are tearing this shit up—they aren’t doing it alone. House Republicans are right there with them…silent and complicit. It’s time for them to show up, do their jobs, and serve the people.

A lot can happen in June. Trust God.
