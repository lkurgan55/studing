Kafka can connect to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect, and provides the Kafka Streams libraries for stream processing applications.
Kafka uses a binary TCP-based protocol that is optimized for efficiency and relies on a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together to reduce the overhead of the network roundtrip.
This "leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks [...] which allows Kafka to turn a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes."[4]

Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn, and was subsequently open sourced in early 2011.
Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede and Jun Rao helped co-create Kafka.[5]
Graduation from the Apache Incubator occurred on 23 October 2012.[6]
Jay Kreps chose to name the software after the author Franz Kafka because it is "a system optimized for writing", and he liked Kafka's work.[7][better source needed]


Apache Kafka is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform.
It is an open-source system developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Java and Scala.
The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.
